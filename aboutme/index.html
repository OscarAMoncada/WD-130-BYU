        <p>Hello everyone! Greetings, I am Venezuelan, in the photo I am with my wife who is from Valdivia, Chile, and with our 9-month-old son Noah who is about to be born :D,
        now we are living in Chile! We have been married for 3 years, we were sealed in the Concepci√≥n Chile Temple. We are practically lifetime members.
        I have served a mission in Valencia Venezuela.</p>
